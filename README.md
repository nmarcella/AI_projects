## About The Project

I'm using this repo to work on AI-related projects. The goal is to learn how to use local open-source LLMs and finetune them with domain-specific data.

My local setup:
1. Ubuntu 22 via Windows WSL2
2. NVIDIA 3080TI
3. 32 GB RAM

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Project 1: Getting Started

The first project is called LLM_with_memory. Here, the goal is to start learning how to use and build on top of OLLAMA. I'll be taking inspiration from Matthew Berman
